    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    For the Dough:
    <ul>
      <li>
        500g strong white bread flour (plus extra for dusting) 10g fine sea salt
      </li>
      <li>
        7g dried yeast or 20g fresh yeast 325ml lukewarm water 1 tablespoon
        olive
      </li>
    </ul>
    For the Sauce:

    <ul>
      <li>1 can (400g) of San Marzano tomatoes,</li>
      <li>crushed 1 clove garlic, minced</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>
        Salt to taste Freshly ground black pepper A few fresh basil leaves,
      </li>
      torn For the Topping:
      <li>
        250g fresh mozzarella, sliced Fresh basil leaves Extra virgin olive oil
        for drizzling
      </li>
      <li>Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> If using dried yeast, mix it with
        the lukewarm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy. If
        using fresh yeast, crumble it into the lukewarm water and stir to
        dissolve.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the flour and
        salt. Make a well in the centre and add the yeast mixture (or dissolved
        fresh yeast) and olive oil. Mix until a sticky dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Transfer the dough onto a floured
        surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place
        the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it
        rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in
        size.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Divide the Dough:</strong> Once risen, knock back the dough
        (punch the air out) and divide it into 2-4 equal portions, depending on
        the desired size of your pizzas. Shape each portion into a ball, cover
        with a damp cloth, and let them rest for another 20 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Making the Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In a bowl, mix the crushed San
        Marzano tomatoes with minced garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and torn
        basil leaves. Adjust seasoning to taste. The sauce should be fresh and
        not overly cooked.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Place a pizza stone in the oven (if
        available) and preheat it to its highest setting (250-300°C or
        482-572°F). Allow it to heat up for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> On a floured surface, take a dough
        ball and, using your hands, gently press it out into a circle. Stretch
        and shape the dough to your desired thickness (typically, Margherita
        pizza has a thin crust).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Sauce and Toppings:</strong> Spread a thin layer of
        tomato sauce over the base, leaving a small border around the edge.
        Arrange the slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce. Drizzle a
        little extra virgin olive oil over the top.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4. Baking the Pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Transfer the pizza to the preheated
        pizza stone or a baking tray. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust
        is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5. Finishing Touches:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately
        sprinkle with fresh basil leaves. Optionally, you can grate some
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on top and drizzle a bit more olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enjoy:</strong> Slice and serve your Margherita pizza hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
